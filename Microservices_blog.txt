The article, Innovation Insight for Microservices, highlights many key ideas regarding usability and capabilities for the use of Microservices. What I found the most interesting were the principles required for its use and how most companies should not use this kind of servicing if there is a lack of business units that don’t know how to adapt to change, use Agile and DevOps practices, and don’t know how to develop unfamiliar design methodologies. Originally, I thought that this practice would be encouraged for all companies, but I’ve learned that it isn’t essential. The main use for microservices is to improve scalability and agility, but there are more than just one way of doing so. I hope to learn what is the process for a company to change from their current service to a microservice in the future.  I’ve also learned that what often happens are that companies market themselves with high level microservice technology but are really using something else with their services. For example, some companies are using reusable services which is really in a sense an anti-microservice because it reduces independence and impacts agility. This article also talked about mini and macro services but went even further in explaining how a lot of people are using them and calling it microservices, and then wonder why they’re not getting their expected results. In order to really be successful with the service, you have to fully embrace all features. Another topic that I found pretty interesting with the use of APIs. During my internship, I never grasped the full understanding of what they’re used for. The article explains how it manages intermicroservice dependencies and communications. It also in many ways promotes independence and pushes on the idea that there should never be direct dependencies between application components. Overall, this article makes me eager to learn more and advance my understanding of different microservices that I’ve used during my internship.
